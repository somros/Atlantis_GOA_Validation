# Atlantis GOA skill assessment and validation

This repo contains utilities to evaluate Atlantis GOA model output versus observations, such as biomass time series from surveys or from stock assessment output, realized catch versus observed (and imposed) catch, etc.

For now it's a stub, about to get populated in the first half of 2023.
